# 🚀 Fine-tune Your Neural Network on the Boston Housing Dataset

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a neural network model for a regression task using the Boston Housing dataset. It provides practical examples of:

- 🏗️ Building a regression model using TensorFlow/Keras  
- ⚙️ Understanding the impact of different optimizers on training  
- 🎛️ Fine-tuning model hyperparameters  
- 💾 Saving and loading trained models for later use  

---

## ✨ Features

- 🏠 Regression on the classic Boston Housing dataset  
- 🔄 Model training and fine-tuning with different optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc.)  
- 📊 Visualization of training loss and validation metrics  
- 💽 Model saving in `.keras` format and loading functionality  
- 📓 Simple and clean Jupyter notebook walkthrough (`Finetune-and-save-your-neural-network.ipynb`)
