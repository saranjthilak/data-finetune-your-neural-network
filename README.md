# Fine-tune Your Neural Network on the Boston Housing Dataset

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a neural network model for a regression task using the Boston Housing dataset. It provides practical examples of:

- Building a regression model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Understanding the impact of different optimizers on training
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters
- Saving and loading trained models for later use

---

## Features

- Regression on the classic Boston Housing dataset
- Model training and fine-tuning with different optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc.)
- Visualization of training loss and validation metrics
- Model saving in `.keras` format and loading functionality
- Simple and clean Jupyter notebook walkthrough (`Finetune-and-save-your-neural-network.ipynb`)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saranjthilak/data-finetune-your-neural-network.git
cd data-finetune-your-neural-network
```
